## About

One may find themselves scratching their head when planning a trip. Where am I going? Where will I stay? How long will I be gone? Will I be greeted with sunshine or rain?

To remedy this questioning, we sought to develop a website that allows the user to see relevant lodging and weather data for wherever they're going.
